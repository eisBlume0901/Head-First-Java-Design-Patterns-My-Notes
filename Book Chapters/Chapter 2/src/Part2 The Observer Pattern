The Observer Pattern defines a one(subject)-to-many(observers) dependency between objects so that
when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated
automatically.

- allows many objects to control the same data
Best examples in-relation to this pattern:
1. Subscription
2. Job Hunting
