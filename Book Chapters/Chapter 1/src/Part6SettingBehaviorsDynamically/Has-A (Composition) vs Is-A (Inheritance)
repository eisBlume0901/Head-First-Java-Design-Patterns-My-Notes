IS-A - inheritance

class Apple extends Fruit {
}
An apple is a fruit.

HAS-A - composition
class Room {
    Table table = new Table();
}

A room has a table.

IS-A vs HAS-A
HAS-A has dynamic (runtime) binding
IS-A has a static (compile time) binding

Tips:
Reuse code and two are not of the same kind? Use composition
Has a natural relationship? Use inheritance
- From the word inherit means the attributes of the parent is inherited by
its child
