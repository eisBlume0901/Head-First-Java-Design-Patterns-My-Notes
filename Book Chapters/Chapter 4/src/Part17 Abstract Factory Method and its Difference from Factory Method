Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related
or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

- it allows client to use an abstract interface to create a set of related
products without or caring about the concrete products that are actually
produced.

Abstract Factory Pattern vs Factory Method Pattern
Factory
1. Create objects through inheritance.
2. Use when you want to decouple client code from concrete classes you need
to instantiate, of if you do not know ahead of time, all the concrete classes
you are going to need. To use, just subclass and implement the factory method.

Abstract Factory
1. Create objects through composition
2. Use whenever you have families of products you need to create and you want
to make sure your clients create products that belong together.
