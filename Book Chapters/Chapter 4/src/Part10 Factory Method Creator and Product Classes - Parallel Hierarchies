Factory method - encapsulates object creation by letting
subclasses decide what objects to create

Creator classes
Abstract classes that declare the factory method which returns an object
of the product class. It might also define a default implementation of
the factory method, but subclasses can override this method to change the
class of product that will be created (Only subclasses actually implement
the factory method and create products). It is written without knowledge
of actual products that will be created.
Example: PizzaStore -> inherited by -> NYPizzaStore, ChicagoPizzaStore,
CaliforniaPizzaStore

Product classes
Classes of objects that the factory method creates. It defines the interface,
which is implemented by all products that the factory method creates.
Example: Pizza -> inherited by -> NYStyleCheesePizza, ChicagoStyleCheesePizza

Parallel Hierarchies
Both creator and product classes has an abstract/interface class
which its subclass can inherit from and override its abstract methods
