Factory Method - encapsulates object creation by
letting subclasses decide what objects create

Encapsulation - does not equate using private keyword
Encapsulation - protective shield that prevents the data
from being accessed by the code outside this shield.

Encapsulation
1. Data Hiding - using private keyword to instance variables, for example,
to prevent accidental modification
2. Bundling Data and Behavior - bundling together the data (fields) and the
behavior (methods) that operates into a single unit (the class) to make
to code easier to understand and maintain because everything related to a
certain piece of data is located in the same place.
3. Controlled Access and Validation - providing public methods (getters, setters)
and modify private fields,
4. Separation of Concerns -
