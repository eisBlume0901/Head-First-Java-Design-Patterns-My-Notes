Principle: Classes should be open for extension, but closed for maintenance

Importance:
1. Not changing the existing code in a class, reduces the change of bugs. If there
is a bug, you can already pinpoint where it would likely be (which is commonly,
the extended ones since we modify and added some features from its super class)
2. Extension allows incorporation of new behavior without modifying existing code.

Reminders:
Applying Open-Closed Principle EVERYWHERE is wasteful and unnecessary, and can
lead to complex, hard-to-understand code. So, choose the areas of code that need
to be extended
