class Beverage {
    String description;

    String getDescription();
    abstract void cost();
}

class HouseBlend extends Beverage {

    @Override
    cost() {
        // price of House Blend beverage
    }
}

class Tea extends Beverage {

    @Override
    cost() {
        // price of House Blend beverage
    }
}

...
There is a lot of different beverage since the customer
could ask for add-on of several condiments such as steamed
milk, soy, mocha, chocolate, and more

Problem:

There will be different class such as:
HouseBlendWithSteamMilkAndMocha
HouseBlendWithWhip
.
.
.

This is hard to maintain because we have to modify the price and always
create a new class for new variation of beverage. Thus, creating a maintenance
nightmare for developers.
